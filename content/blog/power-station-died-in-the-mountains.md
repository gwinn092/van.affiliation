The Goal Zero Yeti 1400 battery percentage reset bug hit us at the worst possible time.

We were deep in the mountains — far enough from a city that getting a replacement wasn't happening for days, maybe longer. The station would show 50–60% remaining, we'd pull a load, and it would crash to zero. Not dead — the battery still had charge — but the BMS had lost track of where it actually was, and we couldn't trust anything it showed us.

We couldn't replace it. We couldn't get it serviced. We had to manage.

This is what survival-mode power management looks like in practice.

## What We Cut First

The first thing we did was figure out our true minimum — the loads we absolutely could not give up and everything else we'd shed.

**Non-negotiable:**
- Fridge. You can't let food spoil in a van in the mountains.
- Phone charging. Navigation, communication, emergency contact.
- Lights, minimally.

**Everything else went off or went manual:**
- Laptop went to phone-only for work. Anything that could wait, waited.
- Fan use minimized — it was cool enough in the mountains that we could manage without much airflow.
- No cooking appliances beyond what ran on propane.
- Charging devices only when we could observe the station directly and disconnect before any crash.

## How We Managed the Broken Station

Since we couldn't trust the percentage display, we managed by behavior observation:

- Short, low-draw charges only. Plug in the phone, watch the station, disconnect.
- Never pulled high-wattage loads. The crash seemed to happen under heavy load — so we kept everything low-draw.
- When we drove, we ran the car charger continuously to put whatever we could back in via alternator.
- We found a campground with electrical hookup as soon as reasonably possible and did a proper full calibration cycle — charge to 100%, drain to zero, charge back to 100% — which reset the BMS and restored the percentage display to accurate behavior.

The alternator charging was the thing that gave us margin when the station's display was useless. Even without knowing the station's true state, a two-hour drive meant we'd put meaningful watt-hours back in. That predictability — independent of whatever the BMS thought — kept us functional.

## What This Taught Us About Backup Plans

Before this trip, I thought about backup plans in terms of extra batteries or a second station. I didn't think enough about *charging path redundancy*.

The alternator was our real backup. Not a backup station — a backup charging path. As long as we could drive, we could put power back into the station regardless of what the display said. That's why the Bluetti Charger 2 is now a permanent part of our setup: not just for efficiency during normal operation, but because a reliable alternator charging path is insurance against the display being wrong.

**The portability lesson came back too.** If we'd had a fixed lithium system in the van, the BMS problem would have been the system problem. There'd be no taking it to a campground hookup to recalibrate, no carrying it anywhere. Because it was a portable station, we had options. We drove to the hookup, ran the calibration cycle, and the problem resolved.

## What We'd Do Now

**Calibrate any new station immediately.** This is what we'd tell every van lifer: before you take a new power station anywhere remote, run a full calibration cycle at home. Charge to 100%, run to zero, charge back to 100%. You want the BMS confident in its reference points before you need the display to be accurate in the field.

**Always have an alternator charging path.** Not just for efficiency — for redundancy. If your primary charging source fails or becomes unreliable, the alternator is the backup that doesn't depend on weather, outlet access, or a functional display.

**Know your minimum load before you need to.** We figured out our true minimum in a stressful situation. It would have been easier to know it in advance. What can your van actually not function without? Know that number. Plan for it.

The power station didn't fail permanently. The calibration cycle fixed it, and we ran it for years after without a recurrence. But the week we spent managing around it in the mountains was a lesson in preparedness that has shaped every power decision we've made since.
